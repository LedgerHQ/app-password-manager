## Quick summary

The Passwords application for Ledger Nano S and Nano X is available for download on the [Ledger Live](https://www.ledger.com/ledger-live/download).

This application demonstrates a Password Manager implemented with no support from the host - the passwords are typed from the Nano S interacting as a keyboard to the connected computer / phone.

## Usage

To create a password:
   * Choose which kind of characters you want in this password (lowercase, uppercase, numbers, dashes, extra symbols)
   * Enter a nickname for the new entry (for instance, "wikipedia.com").
The device then derives a deterministic password from the device's seed and this nickname.

To type a password, just select it in your list of password.

### Application settings
In the application settings, the user can configure
   * Which keyboard the device should emulate when typing a password (Qwerty, International Qwerty or Azerty).

   * If the `Enter` key should be pressed automatically after typing a password (this is convenient for typing start-up password at encrypted servers without attaching display and keyboard, for instance).

## Backup

As passwords are deterministically derived, it's not a problem if you loose your device, as long as you remember the password nicknames and you still have you device recovery phrase to set up again the Passwords app on a new device.

Same applies when updating the device firmware or the application itself, the list of password nicknames won't be restored automatically, so make sure to save a backup using [this tool](https://ledgerhq.github.io/passwords-backup/).

These nicknames are not confidential (meaning, someone who finds them will not be able to retrieve your passwords without your [24-words recovery phrase](https://www.ledger.com/academy/crypto/what-is-a-recovery-phrase)), so you don't have to hide your backup like you did with your recovery phrase. Sending it to yourself by e-mail is fine.

## Password generation mechanism

* Metadatas are SHA-256 hashed

* The SHA-256 components are turned into 8 big endian uint32 | 0x80000000

* A private key and chain code are derived for secp256k1 over 0x80505744 / the path computed before

* The private key and chain code are SHA-256 hashed, the result is used as the entropy to seed an AES DRBG

* A password is generated by randomly choosing from a set of characters using the previously seeded DRBG

## Troobleshooting

* If you configured a password with some charset only, and you get unwanted characters when typing it, check that you have configured the application with the right keyboard. It must be configured like the keyboard settings of your operating systems to type correctly.

* If the keyboard is not recognized by your computer, have a look [here](https://support.ledger.com/hc/en-us/articles/115005165269-Fix-connection-issues)

## Future work

This release is an early alpha - among the missing parts :

   * Support of different password policies mechanisms

   * Offline recovery program

## Credits

This application uses

  * MBED TLS AES DRBG implementation (https://tls.mbed.org/ctr-drbg-source-code)
