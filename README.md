# blue-app-password-manager
Password Manager application for Ledger Blue and Nano S

This application demonstrates a Password Manager implemented with no support from the host - the passwords are typed from the Nano S interacting as a keyboard to the connected computer / phone.

The user can create metadatas on device, and generate a deterministic password from them. 

To compile it, use at least the Nano S SDK 1.2.1 on firmware 1.2

This release is an early alpha - among the missing parts :

   * Ledger Blue support

   * Validation of the HID typing logic on other OS X and Windows - should work on Linux

   * Support of different password policies mechanisms

   * Metadatas backup

   * Offline recovery program

## Password generation mechanism
  
   * Metadatas are SHA-256 hashed 

   * The SHA-256 components are turned into 8 big endian uint32 | 0x80000000
  
   * A private key and chain code are derived for secp256k1 over 0x80505744 / the path computed before

   * The private key and chain code are SHA-256 hashed, the result is used as the entropy to seed an AES DRBG

   * A password is generated by randomly shuffling letters, numbers and special characters using the previously seeded DRBG

## Credits

This application uses 

  * the binary keyboard designed by Parker Hoyes (https://github.com/parkerhoyes/bolos-user-interface), 

  * MBED TLS AES DRBG implementation (https://tls.mbed.org/ctr-drbg-source-code)
